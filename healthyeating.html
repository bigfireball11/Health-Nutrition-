                Micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, play a critical role in supporting immune function, bone health, energy production, and overall well-being.
                Vitamins such as A, C, and E are powerful antioxidants that help neutralize harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage and boosting the immune system. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth. Iron and zinc support blood production and wound healing, respectively. Ensuring a diet rich in a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and lean proteins can help meet the body's micronutrient needs.
            </p>
                In addition to focusing on nutrient density, portion control and mindful eating are important practices to adopt for healthy eating.
                Portion control helps prevent overeating, which can lead to weight gain and other health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. By serving appropriate portion sizes and listening to your body's hunger and fullness cues, you can develop a better relationship with food. Mindful eating encourages slowing down, savoring each bite, and being fully present during meals, which not only enhances digestion but also reduces the tendency to eat out of boredom or emotional triggers.

                Another crucial aspect of healthy eating is staying hydrated. Water is essential for nearly every bodily function, including digestion, nutrient absorption, temperature regulation, and detoxification.
                A well-hydrated body supports better cognitive function, physical performance, and energy levels. While individual hydration needs may vary, a general guideline is to drink at least 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water per day, or more for those engaged in physical activities or living in hot climates. Including water-rich foods such as cucumbers, melons, and oranges can further contribute to maintaining optimal hydration.
